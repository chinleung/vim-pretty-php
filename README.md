# Vim Pretty PHP

Personalized preferences from different non maintained plugins combined into one for my own PHP coding preference.

## Credits

The code used to achieve the result are taken from the following plugins:

- [laurentb/vim-cute-php](https://github.com/laurentb/vim-cute-php)
- [swekaj/php-foldexpr](https://github.com/swekaj/php-foldexpr.vim)
